### Artifacts

1. Standard Learnable Triples (SLT): 
The smallest units of knowledge that apps present, learners learn, and their Learner Record tracks. They are derived from a logically consistent Linquistics Ontology, referenced via a unique IRI, and are unique to a particular language and accent.
SLTs enable a learner to learn from any number of independent sources and update their single Learner Record, provided those applications or live instructors conform to these SLTs.  

2. Linguistic Ontology:
An ontology that extends the Common Core Ontologies to represent elements of spoken and written language.
